I am a Chinese college student majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology at *[Qingdao University of Science and Technology]*. I am very interested in artificial intelligence technology, especially in the fields of *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* and *MultiModal Machine Learning (MMML)*.In addition, I also hope to learn emerging technologies such as *Metaverse* and *Blockchain*. In my freshman year, I established the first AI club in QUST, named *Data Science Research Association (DSRA)*. Currently, I am a full member of *[DataWhale]*, an open source AI organization. Datawhale is committed to building a pure learning circle to help learners grow better. In the future, I hope to build an open source community, and build open source projects that change the world with AI enthusiasts all over the world, creating a new future!
